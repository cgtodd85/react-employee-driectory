## Installation

Please visit the live site for demonstration. If you for the repo you should need only to install the npm packages with npm i, then npm run start to run the app locally on port 3000.

## Usage

Once the site loads you should see a random list of employees. For the sake of this demo app a new set of employees will appear every time the page (app) reloads. You can sort alphabetically by name from a-z, and filter out just a list of male employees for now.

## Development

Need capability to retain the original employee list after sorting or filtering. Add key for each employee in the props.
